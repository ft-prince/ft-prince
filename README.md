# 💫 About Me
💻 I optimize databases until they cry for help.  
🌐 Big fan of Web3 — still waiting for my crypto to go up.  
⚙️ Learning Solidity so I can finally break blockchains *on purpose*.  
💬 Accidentally DDoS’d myself once. It was educational.  
🦆 My rubber ducks know all my bugs (and my secrets).
